Hands on an indefinite comptetion running on Kaggle

Approached this problem using a simple Neural Net and manual feature extraction just to experiment the capabilities of the network.
The network is implemented from sctrach using Numpy and could attain ~80% accuracy on unseen data. (further resolution may be provided later)
